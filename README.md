# nodejs

In this assignment, I made a LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

With LIRI you give a command in Node and it will give back information. For this LIRI I used the following commands:
-concert-this
-spotify-this-song
-movie-this

In future developments I want to include the command "do-what-it-says" command. I was not able to include that in this LIRI.

The following is a video displaying how this works:

The technologies used in the app:
-Javascript
-Node-Spotify-API
-Axios (Axios was used to grab data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API)
-Moment
-DotEnv
-GitHub
